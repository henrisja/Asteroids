# Asteroids
Classic arcade game. Implemented to have traditional single player as well as a two-player battle mode! Had a lot of fun writing this and remembering java :)

In order to start a game just download this repo and run the file 'Driver55.java', good luck!

NOTE: Depending on your machine and its clock speed the game will run at varying speeds, in order to fine tune this just go into 'AsteroidsPanel.java' and either increase the value of the integer in the declaration of 'Timer1' to slow game speed or decrease it to increase game speed.
